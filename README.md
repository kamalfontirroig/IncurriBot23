# IncurriBot23
Selenium bot that logs my worked hours into Nttdata's Jira.

# To use the DEBUGGER
Create a chrome shorcut with these arguments:
"{YourPathToChrome}\chrome.exe" -remote-debugging-port=9014 --user-data-dir="{YourPathToIncurriBot23}\IncurriBot23\debugging"

Then you'll be able to use the DEBUGGER-IncurriBot23.py script to remotely debug chrome at port 9014 and run parts of the script code for debugging.
